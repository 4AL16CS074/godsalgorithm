# GodsAlgorithm
A file ciphering program, produces Dots (.)  in a randomized manner


* This is basically composed to showcase how one can create their own enigma to achieve ultimate privacy in the world, 
using the power of modern languages like python and ofcourse the MATH guy himself.


* The Algorithm is very simple, "THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARDS,(DES)", try not use this in critical 
situation. If you really think this is okay, I strongly command you to change components in the program, and make it
best use of it.


* If you change the core code  for better/parallel performance or implement any new hash function please do a push request
so that I and everybody could learn something out of it.
